Fixed uppercase bug for stream.h in Linux.

#Version 1.02
Fixed stability issue with serial connection
Added NestedDialog example

#Version 1.03
Added 7 more examples

#Version 1.04
Added changes from Dylan, as of forum post: http://www.audeme.com/forum.html#/20160525/pull-request-for-moviarduinoapi-5233546/
to allow the use of HardwareSerial as well as speeding up the ask() method.

#Version 1.05
Fixed bug in ask(F(<string>)) method that would copy the flashed string back to String memory just for checking if it's greater than zero. Added unparametered ask() function.

#Version 1.10
Library uses less String memory
Added features for 1.10 Firmware update
More examples

#Version 1.11
Play() command with Flash memory parameter
Arduino Zero (SAMD architectures) now enabled

#Version 1.12
Workaround for firmware not stopping an ask, pause, play or password command at init
Support for ARDUINO_ARCH_PIC32 (MicroShip UC32 board and others) 

#Version 1.13
Undid workaround as it makes the training less stable. Also workaround not necessary.

#Version 1.1.13
Version 1.1.13 is identical to 1.13. But from now on versioning changes to major.minor.patch to be compatible with Arduino IDE.
