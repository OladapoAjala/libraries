### Sensor

This sensor is designed for comprehensive monitoring of indoor air conditions.
It's responsive to a wide scope of harmful gases such as carbon monoxide, alcohol, acetone, thinner, formaldehyde and so on.
Due to the measuring mechanism, this sensor can not output specific data to describe target gases' concentrations quantitatively.
But it's still competent enough to be used in applications that require only qualitative results, like auto refresher sprayers and auto air cycling systems.
